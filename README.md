# Plugin CI/CD Workflows

This repository contains reusable GitHub Actions workflows and individual actions for building, testing, and deploying Grafana plugins. It provides a standardized CI/CD pipeline that can be easily integrated into any Grafana plugin repository. This repository mostly contains workflows that are relevant to Grafana Labs **internal** teams working on plugins.

For github actions that are suited for external developers see [plugin-actions](https://github.com/grafana/plugin-actions) repository.
