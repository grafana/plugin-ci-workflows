> Please [read the docs](https://enghub.grafana-ops.net/docs/default/component/grafana-plugins-platform/plugins-ci-github-actions/010-plugins-ci-github-actions) before using any of these workflows in your repository.

This folder contains some examples on how to use the shared workflows (CI and CD) in various scenarios.

The `yaml` files should be put in your repository's `.github/workflows` folder, and customized depending on your needs.

**Each workflow file is just a template/example. Remember to address all the TODOs before starting to use the workflows.**
